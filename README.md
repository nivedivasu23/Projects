## Face Emotion Recognition

- **Directory**: `face_emotion_recognition/`
    - **File**: `face_recognition_ai_1.py`
- **Description**: A Python script to recognize facial emotions using computer vision techniques.
- **How to Run**: Run the `face_recognition_ai_1.py` script using Python 3.

## Clustering in R

- **Directory**: `sample program for clustering in r/`
    - **Files**:
        - `Cardiotocographic.csv`: Dataset used for clustering.
        - `assignment code.R`: R script for performing clustering analysis.
- **Description**: A sample R program for clustering analysis on the Cardiotocographic dataset.
- **How to Run**: Execute the R script using an R environment (e.g., RStudio).

## Student Attendance Analysis

- **Directory**: `student attendance/`
    - **Files**: Multiple CSV files representing daily attendance and R scripts for processing.
- **Description**: Analyzes student attendance data across multiple days and generates reports.
- **How to Run**: Use the provided R scripts in an R environment to analyze the CSV files.

## Student Performance Analysis Using Decision Tree

- **Directory**: `student performance analysis using decision tree/`
    - **Files**:
        - `code_decision_tree.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the decision tree analysis.
        - `student_performance.csv`: Dataset for student performance.
- **Description**: Uses a decision tree algorithm to analyze and predict student performance.
- **How to Run**: Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells.
